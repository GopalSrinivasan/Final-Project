Name: Aging Profiles of Baseball Players - Why Do Some Age Better Than Other?

Description: When signing a free agent or extending a player's contract, front offices are always weary of the length of the contract. In the back-half of the contract, players are less likely to be worth their annual salary. However, some players age better than others and are able to produce results at a high level. Our goal here is to determine why cretain players are able to sustain a high level of performance better than others.
